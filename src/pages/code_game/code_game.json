Because of my studies, I am a proficient programmer, problem solver and have a good grasp of mathematics. Outside of my studies, I used to sing in my university's choir, and I also work on various personal projects which include programming related projects (like this website!), independent research, as well as some more \"artsy\" things like poetry.",
