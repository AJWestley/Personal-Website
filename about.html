                    At my core, I am passionate about programming, physics (mostly astronomy), writing, and music. 
                    I have aspirations to get an honours degree both in Computer Science and in Astrophysics, then I'll decide what I want to do from there. <br>
                    The world is so full of opportunities (cliche, I know) and there's so much I want to do, so I like to keep my options open until the time comes where I have to choose. <br>
                    Will I become an astrophysicist? Will I become a machine learning engineer? Will I drop out of uni and become a professional crab tamer?
                    Only time will tell. <br>

                    In 2020 (spooky year), I matriculated from Maritzburg College with an NSC Bachelor's Pass. 
                    After that, I enrolled at Stellenbosch University for BSc Computer Science. 
                    (I'm currently enrolled as a BSc Physics student, but that's just because class schedules are weird.) 
                    Aside from that, I also have a Grade 6 in Music Theory from UNISA and a Grade 6 in Trumpet Performance from Trinity College London.

                    Let's start with the "and such" part. <br>
                    In high school, I did my fair share of extra-curriculars. I was never the sporty type, but I was very involved in the cultural scene.
                    I was in my high school choir and chamber choir, and I played the trumpet in our jazz band. I was also a part of the KZN Midlands Youth Choir 
                    for two years. I was both captain of my high school choir and head boy of the Midlands Youth Choir. <br>
                    I was regularly a part of school stage productions (sometimes in the band, sometimes on stage). The only non-music 
                    extra-curricular I did was esports (yes, I was and still am a gaming nerd). <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am a part the Stellenbosch University Choir 
                    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StellenboschUniversityChoir" target="_blank">obligatory marketing</a>) and the concerts and weekly practices  
                    keep me busy when I'm not doing work. <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as hobbies go, 
                    I enjoy artsy things such as poetry, creative writing, playing guitar (I'm not very good) and singing. 
                    I like to give myself little programming projects when I have the time and want to feel productive. 
                    I keep a telescope with me at uni and like to go star-gazing when the weather permits.
                    I also still play video games, but I find it difficult to make time for them while I'm at uni so I usually keep that for the holidays.

                        1. I love love LOVE space! I keep up to date with most of the latest astronomy news and it's a dream of mine to be an astronaut one day.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        2. I could listen to The 1975 all day, every day. It's totally not a problem.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        3. I have a bent pinky-finger. Sometimes I like to hold it straight then pretend to bend it as a fun party trick.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        4. I don't have any allergies.      ...that I know of...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        5. My family's nickname for me is "Badger", and so I have a Badger tattoo on my arm. (it's not a Hufflepuff tattoo!)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        6. I'm an ENFP! <a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfp-careers" target="_blank">The opening sentence here describes me so perfectly it's scary.</a>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        7. I tell a few too many dad jokes for someone who isn't a dad.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        8. I like to think I have good fashion sense, all thanks to my sister.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        9. I have an irrational fear of moths (as well as other creepy crawlies that are large enough).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        10. I feature on 3 YouTube videos with more than a million views. (basically a celebrity)
