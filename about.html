                    In 2020 (spooky year), I matriculated from Maritzburg College with an NSC Bachelor's Pass. 
                    After that, I enrolled at Stellenbosch University for BSc Computer Science. 
                    (I'm currently enrolled as a BSc Physics student, but that's just because class schedules are weird.) 
                    Aside from that, I also have a Grade 6 in Music Theory from UNISA and a Grade 6 in Trumpet Performance from Trinity College London. <br>

                    In high school, I did my fair share of extra-curriculars. I was never the sporty type, but I was very involved in the cultural scene.
                    I was in my high school choir and chamber choir, and I played the trumpet in our jazz band. I was also a part of the KZN Midlands Youth Choir 
                    for two years. I was both captain of my high school choir and head boy of the Midlands Youth Choir. <br>
                    I was regularly a part of school stage productions (sometimes in the band, sometimes on stage). The only non-music 
                    extra-curricular I did was esports (yes, I was and still am a gaming nerd). <br>
                    <br>
                    Currently, I am a part the Stellenbosch University Choir 
                    (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@StellenboschUniversityChoir" target="_blank">obligatory marketing</a>) and the concerts and weekly practices  
                    keep me busy when I'm not doing work. <br>
                    <br>
                    As far as hobbies go, 
                    I enjoy artsy things such as poetry, creative writing, playing guitar (I'm not very good) and singing. 
                    I like to give myself little programming projects when I have the time and want to feel productive. 
                    I also still play video games, but I find it difficult to make time for them while I'm at uni so I usually keep that for the holidays.
