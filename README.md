# Personal Website
</p>
The code to my personal website.
</br>
I wrote my website as an exercise in learning HTML and CSS, the JavaScript is fairly minimal. 
</br>
I won't go on describing the meat of the website here, <a href="https://ajwestley.me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">go see for yourself!</a>

On the website, under the work page, there is an online image editor.
Here, the user can upload an image and apply some minor edits, then download the result.

### Features
