# Personal Website

The code to my <a href="https://ajwestley.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">personal website</a>. </br>

I initially wrote my website as an exercise in learning HTML and CSS, so the JavaScript was fairly minimal, but a 
year later I rewrote the site with React to make editing the site a bit easier.
